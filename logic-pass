Improve predictions of how much electricity we need
If weâ€™re going to rely on more renewable energy sources, utilities will need better ways of predicting how much energy is needed, in real time and over the long term. Algorithms already exist that can forecast energy demand, but they could be improved by taking into account finer local weather and climate patterns or household behavior. Efforts to make the algorithms more explainable could also help utility operators interpret their outputs and use them in scheduling when to bring renewable sources online.
